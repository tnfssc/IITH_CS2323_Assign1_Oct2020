_You will need `make` and `g++` with standard template library to compile and run this program_

---
## Quickstart
Execute the following in the root directory of the project
> `make main && make Assembler && ./bin/Assembler sample_data/prog1.asm && make ConvertAssembly && ./bin/ConvertAssembly output/prog1bin.txt`

---
## Instructions

**Making**

> Use `make main` to build all the necessary binaries for the rest of the commands  

> Use `make Assembler` to build the Assembler binary and `make ConvertAssembly` to build the ConvertAssembly binary  
Use `make clean` to clean the binaries generated by `make`

**Assembler**

> After `make`-ing `Assembler`, use `./bin/Assembler sample_data/prog*.asm` to run the Assembler  
Output file `prog*bin.txt` is located in `output` folder

**ConvertAssembly**

> After `make`-ing `ConvertAssembly`, use `./bin/ConvertAssembly output/prog*bin.txt` to run the ConvertAssembly  
Output file `bin*prog.asm` is located in `output` folder
